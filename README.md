# Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math. Check out the Tutorial tab to learn more.

# Task
Given an integer, _**n**_ , print its first _**10**_ multiples. Each multiple _**n x i**_ (where _**1 <= i <= 10**_) should be printed on a new line in the form: n x i = result.

# Input Format

A single integer,_**n**_.

# Constraints
* 2 <= n <= 20

# Output Format
Print _**10**_ lines of output; each line _**i**_ (where _**1 <= i <= 10**_) contains the _**result**_ of _**n x i**_ in the form:

n x i = result.

# Sample Input
`2`

# Sample Output
`a | b | c  | d 
:---|:---|:---|:---
 2 |x |1  |= 2
 2 |x |2  |= 4
 2 |x |3  |= 6
 2 |x |4  |= 8
 2 |x |5  |= 10
 2 |x |6  |= 12
 2 |x |7  |= 14
 2 |x |8  |= 16
 2 |x |9  |= 18
 2 |x |10 |= 20`
